    <value>The Imperial Palace in Sremska Mitrovica, known as the Imperial Palace of Sirmium, is one of the most significant archaeological sites in Serbia, a symbol of the power of the former Roman Empire. It is located on the territory of the former Roman city of Sirmium, which in late antiquity was one of the four capitals of the Roman Empire. Sirmium was the seat of several emperors, including Galerius, Maximian, and Constantine I. The palace was built at the end of the 3rd or beginning of the 4th century, in the southeastern part of the city along the Sava River. Archaeological excavations have revealed luxurious mosaics, frescoes, and hypocaust - an underfloor heating system. Materials used in construction came from Egypt, Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy, which speaks of the luxury of the imperial court. The site today includes a Visitor Center with panels, models, and conserved palace remains. The palace is located at Pivarska 2, Sremska Mitrovica, and information can be obtained at numbers +381 22 618 817 and +381 22 621 568. The official website is carskapalata.rs. The Imperial Palace of Sirmium is an unmissable place for all lovers of Roman history and culture.</value>

  <data name="Details_CityPark_FullDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The "Stone Flower" fountain in the City Park of Sremska Mitrovica is one of the most recognizable landmarks of the city, combining art, history, and deep emotional symbolism. It was built in 1948 according to the design of Irina Nepokojčicka, a Russian emigrant and the first female architect in Sremska Mitrovica. The fountain is located on the site of the former "imperial linden tree", planted in 1879 in honor of Emperor Franz Joseph and Empress Elisabeth. It has the shape of a stylized flower with curved petals from which water continuously flows, symbolizing eternal sorrow. According to legend, Irina dreamed of a flower from which a white dove flew out, revealing to her the story of a princess from Sirmium - a symbol of sorrow and longing. Inspired by this dream, Irina created the fountain as a combination of personal and collective sorrow for the homeland and lost times. Irina Nepokojčicka was born in 1909 in Russia, studied architecture in Zagreb, and from 1937 lived and worked in Sremska Mitrovica. Besides the fountain, she worked on the construction of schools, roads, and the reconstruction of the Church of Archdeacon Stephen. She passed away just five months after the completion of the fountain and was buried in the Orthodox Cemetery in Mitrovica. The "Stone Flower" fountain today is a place of gathering, rest, and remembrance - an artistic and spiritual symbol of the city.</value>

The museum building, a gift from the Bajić family, has been preserving and exhibiting archaeological finds from the territory of ancient Sirmium and the wider Srem area since 1946. The Lapidarium displays Roman stone monuments such as sarcophagi, altars, tombstones, and sculptures with mythological motifs.

A unique sundial from around 100 AD and marble sculptures of the goddess Diana and Hercules further enrich the permanent exhibition. Mosaics from the magnificent reception rooms date from the beginning of the 4th century and testify to the luxury of the imperial residence. The Lapidarium's architecture is designed in a neoclassical style with Doric columns, achieving harmony with the city's historical identity. It is open to visitors every weekday from 08:00 to 15:00 and on weekends from 09:00 to 17:00. The exhibition offers a precious insight into the daily life, art, and beliefs of Roman Sirmium.

  <data name="Details_GrainSquare_FullDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Grain Square was part of the craft-trade zone of Sirmium. Excavations have revealed workshops, including glass furnaces, which confirm local glass production during late antiquity. Remains of shops and warehouses have also been found, as well as parts of streets with covered pedestrian paths (porticos) and a sewerage system. The archaeological findings testify to the economic vitality and craftsmanship of Roman Sirmium. The square was a center of trade and production, where various goods were manufactured and exchanged. The discovery of glass furnaces is particularly significant as it shows that Sirmium had its own glass production, which was a luxury industry in Roman times. The remains of shops and warehouses indicate a well-organized commercial district. The covered pedestrian paths (porticos) provided protection from weather conditions and created a pleasant environment for shopping and socializing. The sewerage system shows the high level of urban planning and infrastructure in Roman Sirmium. Today, Grain Square is an important archaeological site that provides insight into the daily life and economy of the ancient city.</value>

  <data name="Details_Basilica_FullDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The Basilica of St. Demetrius in Sremska Mitrovica is one of the most significant early Christian archaeological sites in the territory of ancient Sirmium. Built between 426 and 441 AD, during the time of Prefect Leontius, the basilica represented a three-nave Greek-type building with a central nave and side aisles ending in a transept. Its architecture testifies to the high level of organization of the Christian community in Sirmium during the 5th century. During excavations, 25 graves were found within and around the basilica, confirming its role as a place of worship and burial. Parts of floor mosaics with geometric and floral motifs, characteristic of the art of that period, were also discovered. The basilica was built at a time when Sirmium was one of the four main cities of the Roman Empire and an important episcopal seat. The first known bishop of Sirmium, St. Irenaeus, suffered martyrdom in 304 AD, which further emphasizes the importance of this site. The remains of the basilica are conserved and displayed in an underground archaeological space, located in the city center, near the present Catholic cathedral. The site is accessible to visitors, and more information can be obtained at the Srem Museum. The Basilica of St. Demetrius remains a lasting monument to early Christian faith and the spiritual life of imperial Sirmium.</value>

  <data name="Details_RomanCamp_FullDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The Roman military camp during the time of Sirmium was organized according to strict hierarchy and disciplined structure, with soldiers arranged in rows of tents (tentoria) that formed streets and squares within the fortified camp. Each unit had its own place, and centurions and higher-ranking officers stayed in larger and more organized tents closer to the command center (principia). Soldiers spent their days in training, maintaining equipment, cooking, writing letters, and craft work such as making arrows, repairing weapons, and building fortifications. The rest of the time they used for rest, social games like tabulae or dice games, as well as prayers to warrior gods. Although always ready for battle, their daily life was a mixture of strict discipline, practical duties, and moments of social closeness within the legion. The camp was a microcosm of Roman military life, reflecting the organization and efficiency that made the Roman army one of the most formidable forces in history.</value>
